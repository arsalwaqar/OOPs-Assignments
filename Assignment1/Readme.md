Assignment was done and followings were uploaded:
complex.h       a single complex number having a real and imaginary part with a complex type node for linklist operations and 
                operator functions declarations
                
linklist.h      linked list operations declarations with friend function delaration 

main.cpp        test for all operations

complex.cpp     constructors and operator functions definations  

linklist.cpp    linked list operations definations

Basic tasks given were done 

Additionally:
Operator loading utilized for + - * / == 
In extra a friend size function
Emptying list
Handling if position entered is greater than size or lesser than or equal to zero
a size list as member function that uses friend size function

Tried to optimize code by using overloading constructors, avoiding unnessary variables etc.
